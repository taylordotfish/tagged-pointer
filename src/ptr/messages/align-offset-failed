Error: `align_offset` failed. This is due to one of the following
reasons (most likely one of the first two):

* The pointer passed to `TaggedPtr::new` wasn't aligned enough.

* The pointer passed to `TaggedPtr::new` wasn't "dereferenceable" in
  the sense defined by the documentation for `std::ptr`.

* The current implementation of `align_offset` sometimes or always
  fails, even when called on a `u8` pointer from a non-const context
  where the desired alignment is less than or equal to the alignment
  of the allocation pointed to by the pointer. This shouldn't happen
  in practice, even in Miri with `-Zmiri-symbolic-alignment-check`,
  but is technically allowed. If this happens, please file an issue at
  <https://github.com/taylordotfish/tagged-pointer>. As a workaround,
  enable the `fallback` feature in the "tagged-pointer" crate. This
  avoids relying on `align_offset` at the cost of using twice as much
  memory.
